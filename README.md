# Digital Skills Tool

This work will create prototyped forms to support courses to **improve refugeesâ€™ IT skills and enhance their independency**. It could be a crucial tool to [tackle digital isolation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-50812576). The classes will also have other members of the community. Having learners from different backgrounds will help integrating refugees within the local community.


This course will be developed by **East Renfrewshire Council** in collaboration with **Scottish Enterprise** who will provide the tool. We also worked in partnership with ESOL & Adult Learning services, local Job centre and Bank of Scotland to organise the course. 

This is using the [**GOV.UK Prototype kit**](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs)

_**Digital isolation: The vulnerable people left behind**_
_"Digital isolation is when people find themselves in a position where they can't access the internet or digital media and devices as much as other people", explains Bibi Reisdorf, an assistant professor in communication studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. "In theory, everyone can access the internet, maybe at a library, community centre or at a friend's house, but there are different levels of access." Digital isolation is "surprisingly prevalent", according to Dr Reisdorf, with western countries seeing a rise in "mobile dependence". That doesn't mean people who are addicted to their mobile phones, it's when your mobile is your only access to the internet_
